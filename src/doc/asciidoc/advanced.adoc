== Advanced features

=== Using options

So far, we have discovered how to use different local browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari, PhamtomJS, HtmlUnit), Docker browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera), or even remote browsers with Selenium Grid. In any case, the default options are used. Nevertheless, if you have used intensively Selenium WebDriver, different questions might come to your mind:

* What if I need to specify options (e.g. `ChromeOptions`, `FirefoxOptions`, etc) to my WebDriver object?
* What if need to specify desired capabilities (e.g. browser type, version, platform)?

In order to support the advance features of Selenium WebDriver, _Selenium-Jupiter_ provides several annotations aimed to allow a fine-grained control of the WebDriver object instantiation. These annotations are:

* `Options` (_field-level_): Annotation to configure _options_ (e.g. `ChromeOptions` for Chrome, `FirefoxOptions` for Firefox, `EdgeOptions` for Edge, `OperaOptions` for Opera, and `SafariOptions` for Safari). 
* `Arguments` (_parameter-level_) : Used to add arguments to the options.
* `Preferences` (_parameter-level_) : Used to set preferences to the options.
* `Binary` (_parameter-level_) : Used to set the location of the browser binary.
* `Extensions` (_parameter-level_) : User to add extensions to the browser.

The annotations marked as _parameter-level_ are applied to a single WebDriver parameter. The annotations marked as _field-level_ are applied globally in a test class.

The following https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/advance/ChromeWithOptionsJupiterTest.java[example] shows how to specify options for Chrome. In the first test (called `headlessTest`), we are setting the argument `--headless`, used in Chrome to work as a headless browser. In the second test (`webrtcTest`), we are using two different arguments: `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` and `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`, used to fake user media (i.e. camera and microphone) in https://webrtc.org/[WebRTC] applications. In the third test (`extensionTest`), we are adding an extension to Chrome using the `@Extensions` annotation. The value of this field is an extension file that will be searched: i) using value as its relative/absolute path; ii) using value as a file name in the project classpath.

As introduced before, this annotation `@Options` can be used also at _field-level_, as shown in this other https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/advance/FirefoxWithGlobalOptionsJupiterTest.java[example]. This test is setting to `true` the Firefox preferences `media.navigator.streams.fake` and `media.navigator.permission.disabled`, used also for WebRTC.

=== Template tests

_Selenium-Jupiter_ takes advantage on the standard feature of JUnit 5 called http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-templates[test templates]. Test templates can be seen as an special kind of parameterized tests, in which the test is executed several times according to the data provided by some extension. In our case, the extension is _Selenium-Jupiter_ itself, and the test template is configured using a custom file in JSON called *browsers scenario*. 

Let's see some examples. Consider the following test. A couple of things are new in this test. First of all, instead of declaring the method with the usual `@Test` annotation, we are using the JUnit 5's annotation `@TestTemplate`. With this we are saying to JUnit that this method is not a regular test case but a template. Second, the parameter type of the method `templateTest` is `WebDriver`. This is the generic interface of Selenium WebDriver, and the concise type (i.e. `ChromeDriver`, `FirefoxDriver`, `RemoteWebDriver`, etc.) will be determined by _Selenium-Jupiter_ in runtime.

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/template/TemplateTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

The last piece we need in this test template is what we call _browser scenario_. As introduced before, this scenario is defined in a JSOn file following a simple notation.

The path of the JSON browser scenario is established in the configuration key called `sel.jup.browser.template.json.file`. By default, this key has the value `classpath:browsers.json`. This means that the JSON scenario is defined in a file called `browsers.json` located in the classpath (see section link:#configuration[Configuration] for further details about configuration).

NOTE: If the configuration key `sel.jup.browser.template.json.file` do not start with the word `classpath:`, the file will be searched using relative of absolute paths.

Now imagine that the content of the file `browsers.json` is as follows:

[source,json]
----
include::../../test/resources/browsers-docker.json[indent=0]
----

When we execute the template test, in this case we will have four actual tests: the first using the _latest_ version of Chrome, the second using the previous to stable version of Chrome (`latest-1`), the third using the beta version of Chrome (`beta`), and another test using the development version of Chrome (`unstable`). For instance, if we run the test in Eclipse, we will get the following output:

[.thumb]
.Example of test template execution in Eclipse
image::test-template-01.png[scaledwidth=100%]

Generally speaking, a browser within the JSON scenario is defined using the following parameters:

- `type`: Type of browsers. The accepted values are:
   * `chrome`: For local Chrome browsers.
   * `firefox`: For local Firefox browsers.
   * `edge`: For local Edge browsers.
   * `iexplorer`: For local Internet Explorer browsers.
   * `opera`: For local Opera browsers.
   * `safari`: For local Safari browsers.
   * `appium`: For local mobile emulated devices.
   * `phantomjs`: For local PhtanomJS headless browsers.
   * `chrome-in-docker`: For Chrome browsers in Docker.
   * `firefox-in-docker`: For Firefox browsers in Docker.
   * `opera-in-docker`: For Opera browsers in Docker.
   * `android`: For web browsers in Android devices in Docker containers.
- `version`: Optional value for the version. Wildcard for latest versions (`latest`, `latest-1`, etc) are accepted. Concrete versions are also valid (e.g. `63.0`, `58.0`, etc., depending of the browser). **Beta** and **unstable** (i.e. development) versions for Chrome and Firefox are also supported (using the labels `beta` and `unstable` labels respectively).
- `deviceName`: Also for `android` type, the device type can be specified (Samsung Galaxy S6, Nexus 4, Nexus 5, etc.).


Finally, more than one parameters can be defined in the test template. For instance, consider the following test in which a couple of `WebDriver` parameters are declared in the test template.

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/template/TemplateTwoBrowsersTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

The JSON scenario should be defined accordingly. Each browser array in this case (for each test template execution) should declare two browsers. For instance, using the following JSON scenario, the first execution will be based on Chrome in Docker (first parameter) and Firefox in Docker (second parameter); and the second execution will be based on a local Chrome (first parameter) and the headless browser PhantomJS (second parameter).

[source,json]
----
include::../../test/resources/browsers-two.json[indent=0]
----

If we execute this test using in GUI, the JUnit tab shows two tests executed with the values defined in the JSON scenario.

image::test-template-02.png[scaledwidth=100%]

As of version 2.2.0, _Selenium-Jupiter_ allows to configure the browser scenario programmatically using the JUnit 5 `@RegisterExtension` annotation. To that aim, the method `addBrowsers` of the `SeleniumExtension` instance is used to add different browser(s) to the scenario. In the following example the test is executed twice, one using Chrome and the second using Firefox.

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/template/TemplateRegisterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

=== Generic driver

As of version 2.1.0, _Selenium-Jupiter_ allows to use a configurable WebDriver object. This generic driver is declared as usual (i.e. as test method or constructor parameter) using the type `RemoteWebDriver` or `WebDriver`. The concrete type of browser to be used is established using the configuration key `sel.jup.default.browser`. The default value for this key is `chrome-in-docker`. All the values used in the template test defined in the previous section (i.e. `chrome`, `firefox`, `edge`, `chrome-in-docker`, `firefox-in-docker`, `android`, etc.) can be used also to define the type of browser in this mode.

For instance, the following test, if no additional configuration is done, will use Chrome in Docker as browser:

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/generic/GenericTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

If the resolution of this browser finishes with exception (for instance, when executing the test in a host without Docker), a list of browser fallback will be used. This list is managed using the configuration key `sel.jup.default.browser.fallback`. By default, this key has the value `chrome,firefox,safari,edge,phantomjs`, meaning that the first fallback browser is a local Chrome, then local Firefox, then local Safari, then local Edge, and finally PhantomJS (headless browser).

The version of the generic browser (in case of Docker browsers) is managed with the key `sel.jup.default.version` (`latest` by default). The versions of the fallback browsers can be also managed, this time using the configuration key `sel.jup.default.browser.fallback.version`.


=== Integration with Jenkins

_Selenium-Jupiter_ provides seamless integration with Jenkins through one of its plugins: the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JUnit+Attachments+Plugin[Jenkins attachment plugin]. The idea is to provide the ability to attache output files (typically PNG screenshots and MP4 recordings of Docker browsers), and keep these files attached to the job execution. This is done in _Selenium-Jupiter_ setting the configuration key `sel.jup.output.folder` to an special value: `surefire-reports`.

When this configuration key is configured with that value, _Selenium-Jupiter_ will store the generated files in the proper folder, in a way that the Jenkins attachment plugin is able to find those files and export them in the Jenkins GUI. For instance, consider the following https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/docker/DockerFirefoxWithOptionsJupiterTest.java[test], when is executed in Jenkins (with the attachment plugin) and the following configuration:

[source]
----
mvn clean test -Dtest=DockerFirefoxWithOptionsJupiterTest -Dsel.jup.recording=true -Dsel.jup.output.folder=surefire-reports -Dsel.jup.screenshot.at.the.end.of.tests=true
----

In this case, at the the execution of this test, two recordings in MP4 and two screenshots in PNG will be attached to the job as follows. 

[.thumb]

image::jenkins-attachements-test.png[scaledwidth=100%]

We can watch the recording simply clicking in the attached MP4 files.

image::jenkins-attachements-test-mp4.png[scaledwidth=100%]

Test template are also compatible with this feature. For instance, consider the following test
https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/template/TemplateTest.java[test]. When is executed in Jenkins using the configuration below, the following attachments will be available on Jenkins:

[source]
----
mvn clean test -Dtest=TemplateTest -Dsel.jup.recording=true -Dsel.jup.output.folder=surefire-reports -Dsel.jup.screenshot.at.the.end.of.tests=true
----

And we will be able to watch the recording:

=== Using Genymotion

The use of https://www.genymotion.com/[Genymotion] for using Android devices in the cloud is possible as of Selenium-Jupiter 3.1.0. This feature is used using a Software as a Service (SaaS) approach. In order to use this feature, we need to select `GENYMOTION_SAAS` in the `cloud` parameter of `@DockerBrowser` in a test. First, we need a valid Genymotion account. This account will be configured using the methods `setAndroidGenymotionUser()`, `setAndroidGenymotionPassword()` and `setAndroidGenymotionLicense()` for user, password, and license respectively. Moreover, we need to specify the following values:

- Genymotion template name (method `setAndroidGenymotionTemplate()`).
- Android version (method `setAndroidGenymotionAndroidVersion()`).
- Android API level (method `setAndroidGenymotionAndroidApi()`).
- Android screen size (method `setAndroidGenymotionScreenSize()`).

All this values will be internally managed using a label specified with `setAndroidGenymotionDeviceName()`. This label will be used later in the actual test in the `deviceName` value. The following test shows an example:

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/android/AndroidGenymotionJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

We can see the execution of the test in the https://cloud.geny.io/[Genymotion dashboard] while the test is being executed. For the example before, we see the following Android device:

[.thumb]
.Example of test execution in Genymotion
image::genymotion.png[scaledwidth=50%]

Notice that _Selenium_Jupiter_ downloads the _chromedriver_ binary required by internal Appium server contained in the internal Docker container which is used to connect with Genymotion SaaS. By default, the version of the _chromedriver_ binary is related with the installed browser. The following table shows a summary of the _chromedriver_ versions managed by _Selenium_Jupiter_ depending on the Android API level. It other version of _chromedriver_ is required, it can specified using the method `setAndroidGenymotionChromedriver()`.

|==========================

=== Single session

By default, the instances provided by _Selenium_Jupiter_ (e.g. `ChromeDriver`, `FirefoxDriver`, etc) are created **before each** test, and are disposed **after each** test. As of _Selenium_Jupiter_ 3.3.0, this default behavior can be changed using the class-level annotation `@SingleSession`. The instances provided in this case will be created **before all** tests, and are disposed **after all** tests.

The following test shows an example of this feature. As you can seen, this test uses the ordering capability provided as of JUnit 5.4. The browser (Chrome in this case) is available at the beginning for the tests. According to the given order, first `testStep1()` is executed. Then, the session (i.e. the same browser in the same state) is used by the second test, `testStep2()`. An the end of all tests, the browser is closed.

=== Selenium-Jupiter CLI

As of version 2.1.0, _Selenium-Jupiter_ can used interactively from the shell as a regular command line interface (CLI) tool. In this mode, _Selenium-Jupiter_ allows to get the VNC session of Docker browser. There are two ways of using this feature:

* Directly from the source code, using Maven. The command to be used is `mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="browserName <version>"`. For instance:

=== Selenium-Jupiter Server

As of version 3.0.0, Selenium-Jupiter can used as a server. To start this mode, the shell is used. Once again, two options are allowed:

* Directly from the source code and Maven. The command to be used is ``mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="server <port>"``. If the second argument is not specified, the default port will be used (4042):
